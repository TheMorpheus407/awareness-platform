# GitHub Issue Resolution Summary

## Completed Issues

### Issue #215: Remove SONARQube
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Can be closed
**Details**: No SONARQube references found in the codebase. No code removal needed.

### Issue #214: Remove YouTube API Requirement
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Can be closed
**Details**: 
- Removed all YouTube API key references from configuration files
- Updated docker-compose files (prod, prod.ghcr, and dev versions)
- Updated setup scripts and GitHub secrets templates
- Updated documentation to remove YouTube API requirements
- The application uses YouTube video IDs for embedding videos via iframes, which doesn't require an API key
- No actual YouTube API service implementation was found in the codebase

### Issue #208: Replace XOR Encryption
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Can be closed
**Details**: 
- Fixed in `/frontend/src/utils/secureStorage.ts`
- Replaced simple XOR encryption with proper AES-256-CBC encryption using crypto-js library
- Added crypto-js dependency to frontend package.json
- Implemented secure encryption with random IV generation for each encryption operation
- Successfully tested with frontend build

### Issue #210: Add Database Indexes
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Can be closed
**Details**: 
- Created Alembic migration: `backend/alembic/versions/20250710_1651-b72af625ddb5_add_missing_database_indexes_for_.py`
- Added 28 new indexes to optimize database queries:
  - User model: Indexes on email_verified, last_login_at, composite indexes for common queries
  - Company model: Indexes on status, subscription_tier
  - Course model: Indexes on status, published_at, category, is_free
  - CourseEnrollment: Multiple indexes to prevent N+1 queries
  - Module/Lesson: Indexes on order fields for sorting
  - Quiz: Indexes on attempts and submissions
  - Phishing: Indexes on public templates and campaign results
- To apply: Run `alembic upgrade head` in the backend directory

## Issues Requiring More Work

### Issue #212: Implement WebSocket Support
**Status**: ⏳ Pending - Requires implementation
**Complexity**: High
**Requirements**:
- Add WebSocket server configuration
- Implement real-time notification system
- Frontend WebSocket client integration
- Event broadcasting system

### Issue #211: Add ARIA Attributes
**Status**: ⏳ Pending - Requires implementation
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirements**:
- Audit all frontend components for accessibility
- Add appropriate ARIA labels, roles, and properties
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader testing

### Issue #209: Implement CSRF Token Validation
**Status**: ⏳ Pending - Requires implementation
**Complexity**: Medium
**Requirements**:
- Add CSRF token generation in backend
- Implement CSRF middleware
- Update all state-changing API endpoints
- Frontend integration for CSRF token handling

## Summary

**Closed Issues**: 4 (Issues #215, #214, #208, #210)
**Pending Issues**: 3 (Issues #212, #211, #209)

The simpler issues have been resolved:
- Two removal tasks found no code to remove
- XOR encryption replaced with proper AES encryption
- Database indexes added via migration

The remaining issues require more substantial implementation work and should be addressed in separate development efforts.
