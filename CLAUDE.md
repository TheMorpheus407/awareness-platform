# CLAUDE.md - Cybersecurity Awareness Platform

## üéØ MISSION
Build a PERFECT, fully automated cybersecurity awareness platform that NEVER stops improving until it reaches 100% completion and market-leading quality. This is an AUTONOMOUS development system that evolves through stages.

## ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS OPERATION MODE
- **NEVER ASK FOR PERMISSION** - Execute all tasks immediately
- **ALWAYS CONTINUE** - After each task, automatically proceed to the next
- **SELF-HEALING** - Fix any errors encountered and continue
- **EVOLUTION-BASED** - Complete each stage fully before advancing
- **PERFECTION-DRIVEN** - Iterate until metrics show 100% quality

## üß† GEMINI INTEGRATION
Use `gemini` CLI for:
- Large context analysis: `gemini -p "Analyze entire codebase architecture" -a`
- Visual documentation: `gemini -p "Create architecture diagram for [component]"`
- Complex refactoring: `gemini -p "Suggest optimizations for entire module" -a`
- Code review: `gemini -p "Review code quality and suggest improvements" -a`

## MASTER CLAUDE vs SLAVE CLAUDE
Master Claude can ALWAYS invoke as many SLAVE CLAUDES as he wants. There are claude commands, that you can execute, eg CLI: claude "Begin Stage 1 - Initialize project structure" or any other Claude Master sees fit. He can spawn as many as he likes and they will just DO a task. The slaves will be orchestrated by the master.
But think about Slaves this way: They are simple code monkeys - experts in their area, but only in one at a time. They will only achieve ONE single task, that can be done in max 1h. They wont just "Fix all...".
A slave could be for
- deployment
- fixing one issue
- creating an issue
- analyzing something
- updating docs
- testing
- test writing
- course creation via LATEX
- ...
[You may update more Slave ideas here, that you found worked well; You really dont need to do everything yourself :)]

## üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE

Remember we're using 
- venv
- git via gh in the commandline, including branches, which you can HEAVILY use for your slaves
- The coder slaves can use pull requests, a reviewer slave can review it, you will merge it etc
- You have FULL access to the Server via SSH (you may even use sudo). The keys are in bootstrap-awareness private key.txt and bootstrap awareness public key.txt
- You can and will use Github Actions. You have the permission to push AND deploy, since this project is NOT yet in production. 
- The project is live on bootstrap-awareness.de - you can always look at the project, curl URLs or APIs etc 
- we are only developing the prototype, we dont have customers yet, but make sure everything is stable and secure to use, we are acquiring customers as we speak
- You are running in a WSL, the server has Ubuntu 24 LTS.
