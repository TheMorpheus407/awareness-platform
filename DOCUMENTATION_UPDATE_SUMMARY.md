## 📋 Key Changes Made

### Backend Structure Updates
All documentation now correctly reflects that the backend code is in `backend/backend/` directory:
- Import paths: `from backend.main import app`
- Working directory: `cd /app/backend`
- Script paths: `python backend/scripts/script_name.py`

### API Path Updates
- Production URL: `https://bootstrap-awareness.de/api`
- No version in URL (was `/api/v1/`, now `/api/`)
- Correct domain in all examples

### Command Updates
All Docker exec commands now use:
```bash
docker exec backend-container bash -c "cd /app/backend && [command]"
```

## 🎯 Documentation Accuracy

All documentation now accurately reflects:
1. Current project structure with backend/backend layout
2. Correct API endpoints and URLs
3. Proper database initialization procedures
4. Comprehensive troubleshooting steps
5. Emergency recovery procedures

## 📝 Notes

- The TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide is particularly comprehensive and should help resolve most common issues
- All commands have been tested for the backend/backend structure
- Documentation is now consistent across all files
- References between documents are properly linked
