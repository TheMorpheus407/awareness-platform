# ADR-001: Use FastAPI for Backend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a Python web framework for building the backend API of our cybersecurity awareness platform. The framework should support:
- Modern async/await patterns for high performance
- Automatic API documentation
- Strong typing and validation
- Easy integration with SQL databases
- Good developer experience
- Active community and ecosystem

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as our backend framework.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Automatic API documentation**: FastAPI generates OpenAPI (Swagger) docs automatically
- **High performance**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, one of the fastest Python frameworks
- **Type safety**: Full type hints support with runtime validation via Pydantic
- **Modern Python**: Leverages Python 3.8+ features like async/await
- **Developer experience**: Excellent IDE support, auto-completion, and fewer bugs
- **Standards-based**: Built on open standards (OpenAPI, JSON Schema)
- **Active development**: Rapidly growing community and ecosystem
- **Security features**: Built-in security utilities and OAuth2 support

### Negative
- **Relative maturity**: Newer framework compared to Django or Flask
- **Smaller ecosystem**: Fewer third-party packages compared to Django
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn FastAPI-specific patterns
- **Less "batteries included"**: Need to make more architectural decisions

### Neutral
- Different from traditional MVC frameworks
- Requires understanding of async programming
- More explicit than Django's "magic"

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Django REST Framework**
   - Pros: Mature, batteries-included, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Heavier, synchronous by default, more opinionated
   - Not chosen: Overkill for API-only backend, slower performance

2. **Flask + Flask-RESTful**
   - Pros: Simple, flexible, large community
   - Cons: Requires many additional libraries, no built-in async
   - Not chosen: Would require significant setup, no automatic documentation

3. **Tornado**
   - Pros: Async support, good for real-time features
   - Cons: Lower-level, less convenient for REST APIs
   - Not chosen: Not optimized for REST API development

4. **Sanic**
   - Pros: Fast, async support
   - Cons: Smaller community, less mature
   - Not chosen: FastAPI offers better developer experience
