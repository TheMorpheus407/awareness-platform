# Backend Test Suite Report

## Summary
Successfully improved the backend test suite from a failing state to a partially passing state with comprehensive test coverage for new features.

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 154
- **Passed**: 41 (26.6%)
- **Failed**: 73
- **Errors**: 40
- **Skipped**: 20

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. Async Test Infrastructure
- Updated `conftest.py` to properly support async fixtures using `pytest_asyncio`
- Fixed async client and database session fixtures
- Resolved fixture dependency issues

### 2. Model Property Corrections
- Fixed `is_verified` → `email_verified` property mapping
- Updated `two_factor_*` → `totp_*` property names throughout
- Fixed `SubscriptionTier.BASIC` → `SubscriptionTier.FREE`

### 3. Missing Functionality
- Added `create_email_verification_token()` to `core/security.py`
- Added `create_password_reset_token()` to `core/security.py`
- Fixed `CourseAssignment` → `UserCourseProgress` model references

### 4. New Test Suites Created
- **Email Verification Tests** (`test_email_verification.py`)
  - Send verification email
  - Verify email with token
  - Handle invalid/expired tokens
  - Rate limiting tests

- **Password Reset Tests** (`test_password_reset.py`)
  - Request password reset
  - Verify reset tokens
  - Reset password with validation
  - Rate limiting tests

- **Row Level Security Tests** (`test_rls.py`)
  - User data isolation
  - Company admin permissions
  - Course progress visibility
  - Superuser bypass

- **Landing Page Tests** (`test_landing.py` - disabled)
  - Public statistics
  - Featured courses
  - Contact forms
  - Demo requests

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Route Registration
Many tests fail with 404 errors, suggesting routes may not be properly registered or test URLs are incorrect.

### 2. Email Verification Token Storage
The `email_verification_token` field is not present in the User model but is referenced in the auth route.

### 3. Database Compatibility
RLS tests require PostgreSQL-specific features that don't work with SQLite test database.

### 4. Async Test Issues
Some async tests still have issues with proper fixture usage and database session management.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Route Registration**: Review `api/__init__.py` and ensure all routes are properly included
2. **Implement Token Storage**: Add email verification token model or field
3. **Update Test URLs**: Ensure test URLs match actual API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/` vs `/api/v1/auth/`)

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Use PostgreSQL for Tests**: Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for full feature compatibility
2. **Increase Coverage Target**: Update `pytest.ini` to require 90% coverage
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. **CI/CD Test Matrix**: Test against multiple Python versions and database engines

## Test Coverage Areas

### Well-Covered
- Authentication flows (register, login, refresh)
- Two-factor authentication
- Basic CRUD operations

### Needs Improvement
- Email sending functionality
- File upload/download
- WebSocket connections (if applicable)
- Background task execution

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/api/routes/test_auth.py

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -xvs
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix the email verification token storage issue
2. Ensure all API routes are properly registered
3. Update remaining tests to use correct async fixtures
4. Consider implementing test factories for complex objects
5. Add performance benchmarks to critical paths
