# Frontend Test Fixes Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Global Mock Conflicts in setup.ts
**Issue**: The global mock for `useAuthStore` in `setup.ts` was preventing the authStore tests from running properly.
**Fix**: Removed the global mock from setup.ts to allow individual test files to mock as needed.

### 2. AuthStore Test Issues
**Issue**: Multiple issues with async handling, promise expectations, and mock setup.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Simplified mock setup using direct vi.fn() assignments
- Fixed async/await patterns in tests
- Properly wrapped async operations in act() 
- Fixed promise rejection expectations
- Added proper localStorage mock with state management

### 3. Component Test Updates
**Issue**: Login component test was using incorrect mock setup and expectations.
**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed to mock `useAuth` hook instead of `useAuthStore` directly
- Updated login call expectations to match actual implementation (separate email/password args)
- Added missing `isLoading` property to mock return value

### 4. Lucide-React Icon Mocking
**Issue**: Icons from lucide-react need proper mocking for tests.
**Fix**: Already properly mocked in setup.ts using a Proxy that returns test-friendly components.

### 5. React-Hot-Toast Mocking
**Issue**: Toast notifications need proper mocking.
**Fix**: Created a manual mock in `src/__mocks__/react-hot-toast.ts` with all required methods.

### 6. API Client Mocking
**Issue**: The API client was creating axios instances during import causing issues.
**Fix**: Created a manual mock in `src/services/__mocks__/api.ts` with all required methods.

## Test Environment Setup
- Vitest v1.6.1
- Node v20.7.0
- npm v10.1.0
- React Testing Library
- jsdom environment

## Files Modified
1. `/src/test/setup.ts` - Removed global useAuthStore mock
2. `/src/store/authStore.test.ts` - Complete rewrite with simplified approach
3. `/src/components/Auth/Login.test.tsx` - Updated to mock useAuth hook
4. `/vitest.config.ts` - Verified configuration (no changes needed)
5. Created `/src/__mocks__/react-hot-toast.ts`
6. Created `/src/services/__mocks__/api.ts`

## Known Issues
- Test runner appears to hang when running tests. This may be due to:
  - WSL2 environment performance issues
  - Node modules corruption
  - Vitest configuration issues with the current setup

## Recommendations
1. Run tests in a native Linux environment or Windows directly for better performance
2. Consider using `vitest run --pool=forks` for better isolation
3. Ensure all async operations in tests are properly awaited
4. Use manual mocks for complex dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Verify all component tests pass with the updated mocking strategy
2. Fix any remaining E2E test issues
3. Add missing test coverage for new components
4. Consider upgrading to latest versions of testing libraries
