# Analytics Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive analytics dashboard has been implemented for the cybersecurity awareness platform, providing real-time insights and business intelligence capabilities.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 006)
- **Analytics Schema**: Created dedicated `analytics` schema for performance isolation
- **Tables Created**:
  - `analytics_events`: Track all user events and interactions
  - `course_analytics`: Aggregated course metrics by day and company
  - `user_engagement`: User activity and engagement metrics
  - `revenue_analytics`: Financial metrics and subscription tracking
  - `phishing_analytics`: Phishing simulation performance metrics
  - `realtime_metrics`: Real-time dashboard metrics with TTL
  - `company_overview`: Materialized view for dashboard performance

### 2. Models (`backend/models/analytics.py`)
- SQLAlchemy models for all analytics tables
- Relationships with existing models (User, Company, Course, etc.)
- Indexes for optimal query performance
- Row-level security policies for multi-tenant access

### 3. API Endpoints (`backend/api/routes/analytics.py`)
- `POST /api/v1/analytics/events`: Track analytics events
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard`: Comprehensive dashboard metrics
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/courses`: Course-specific analytics
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/engagement`: User engagement data
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/revenue`: Revenue analytics (admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/phishing`: Phishing campaign analytics
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/realtime`: Real-time metrics
- `POST /api/v1/analytics/export`: Export analytics data
- `POST /api/v1/analytics/refresh-materialized-views`: Refresh cached data

### 4. Analytics Collection Service (`backend/services/analytics_collector.py`)
- Automated daily analytics aggregation
- Methods for collecting:
  - Course completion and progress metrics
  - User engagement and activity patterns
  - Revenue and subscription analytics
  - Phishing simulation results
  - Real-time metric updates

### 5. Scheduled Tasks
- Daily analytics collection script (`backend/scripts/collect_analytics.py`)
- Systemd service and timer for automated execution
- Cron job configuration for flexibility

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Components (`frontend/src/components/Analytics/`)
- **AnalyticsDashboard.tsx**: Main analytics dashboard with KPIs and charts
- **CourseAnalytics.tsx**: Detailed course performance analytics
- **UserEngagementAnalytics.tsx**: User activity and engagement tracking
- **MetricCard.tsx**: Reusable KPI display component
- **DateRangePicker.tsx**: Date range selection for analytics
- **ExportButton.tsx**: Export analytics to CSV/Excel/PDF

### 2. Visualizations
Using Recharts library for data visualization:
- Line charts for trends over time
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Pie charts for distribution analysis
- Area charts for stacked metrics
- Scatter plots for correlation analysis
- Radar charts for multi-dimensional metrics

### 3. Features Implemented
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard refreshes with latest data
- **Date Range Filtering**: View analytics for different time periods
- **Role-based Access**: Different views for admins, managers, and employees
- **Export Functionality**: Download analytics in multiple formats
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent with platform theme

### 4. Key Metrics Displayed
- **User Metrics**: Total users, active users, new registrations
- **Course Metrics**: Enrollments, completions, average progress
- **Engagement Metrics**: Time spent, page views, activity patterns
- **Revenue Metrics**: MRR, subscriptions, revenue growth (admin only)
- **Performance Metrics**: Quiz scores, completion rates, learning velocity

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregated data for fast dashboard loading
2. **Indexed Queries**: Optimized database indexes for common queries
3. **Caching Strategy**: Real-time metrics with TTL for freshness
4. **Batch Processing**: Daily aggregation reduces query load

### Security Features
1. **Row-Level Security**: Users only see data from their company
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different analytics based on user role
3. **Data Privacy**: PII protection in analytics collection
4. **Audit Trail**: All analytics events are tracked

### Scalability
1. **Separate Schema**: Analytics isolated from operational data
2. **Async Processing**: Background jobs for data aggregation
3. **Efficient Storage**: Daily aggregation reduces data volume
4. **Query Optimization**: Indexed and partitioned for large datasets

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to Analytics from the sidebar
2. View comprehensive dashboard with all metrics
3. Switch between dashboard, course, and user analytics tabs
4. Export data for external reporting
5. Monitor real-time platform usage

### For Managers
1. Access analytics relevant to your team
2. Track course completion and engagement
3. Identify training gaps and opportunities
4. Export team performance reports

### For Employees
1. View personal engagement metrics
2. Track learning progress
3. Compare performance with averages
4. Set personal learning goals

## Deployment Instructions

### Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head  # Runs migration 006
```

### Start Analytics Collection
```bash
# Manual run
python backend/scripts/collect_analytics.py

# Setup automated collection
sudo cp deployment/systemd/analytics-collector.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable analytics-collector.timer
sudo systemctl start analytics-collector.timer
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Already installed recharts and @headlessui/react
npm run dev  # Analytics available at /analytics
```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Predictive Analytics**: ML models for user behavior prediction
2. **Custom Reports**: User-defined analytics dashboards
3. **Real-time Alerts**: Notifications for significant events
4. **Advanced Visualizations**: Heatmaps, Sankey diagrams
5. **API Analytics**: Track API usage and performance
6. **Benchmarking**: Compare with industry standards
7. **A/B Testing**: Built-in experimentation framework
