### 3. API Endpoints (✅ Complete)

Created comprehensive payment API in `backend/api/routes/payments.py`:

## Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**:
   - No credit card details stored in database
   - All sensitive data handled by Stripe
   - Only tokens and references stored locally

2. **Webhook Security**:
   - Signature verification for all webhooks
   - Idempotent webhook processing
   - Error handling for failed webhooks

3. **Access Control**:
   - Company admin required for payment operations
   - Users can only access their company's data
   - Secure API endpoints with authentication

## Configuration Required

Add these environment variables to `.env`:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/success
STRIPE_CANCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/cancel
```

## Stripe Product Setup

Create products and prices in Stripe Dashboard:

1. **Products**: Create products for each tier (Basic, Starter, Premium, Professional, Enterprise)
2. **Metadata**: Add `tier` metadata to each product (e.g., "starter", "premium")
3. **Prices**: Create monthly and yearly prices for each product
4. **Features**: Add `features` metadata as JSON array to products

Example product metadata:
```json
{
  "tier": "starter",
  "features": "[\"Up to 50 users\", \"Basic phishing simulations\", \"5 training courses\", \"Monthly reports\"]"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Subscription

```typescript
// Frontend
const { client_secret } = await paymentService.createSetupIntent();
// Use Stripe Elements to collect payment
const subscription = await paymentService.createSubscription({
  price_id: 'price_starter_monthly',
  payment_method_id: 'pm_xxx'
});
```

### Webhook Processing

Stripe webhooks are automatically processed for:
- Subscription creation/updates/deletion
- Payment successes/failures
- Invoice creation/payment
- Payment method attachment/detachment

## Next Steps

1. **Production Setup**:
   - Configure production Stripe keys
   - Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
   - Configure proper return URLs

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Implement usage-based billing for active users
   - Add proration previews for plan changes
   - Implement subscription pause/resume
   - Add payment retry logic

3. **Admin Features**:
   - System admin billing overview
   - Revenue analytics
   - Failed payment notifications

4. **Customer Portal**:
   - Integrate Stripe Customer Portal
